To exemplify what is at issue here, start by imagining that there was a platform through which you could make appointments for any specialty in any hospital (public or private), that analyzed prices, agreements, available medical teams, etc. And that using this system, the doctor who attended you had access to your entire medical 
history, including labs and vitals, if you so desired. And if you were told that all this was within the reach of an application on your cell phone that also allowed you to manage, among other things, your appointments, medication purchases, and view real-time vitals data acquired by a smart band device?

Well, our proposal is a centralized service with all these features that aims to make everything simpler and more intuitive, so that your health can be in your hands.

In this project we cover functionalities, market needs, business risks, scope and limitations, resources, functions and responsibilities, methodology, etc.
